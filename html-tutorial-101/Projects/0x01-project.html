        <h2>Favorite Memory: First Time Seeing the Ocean</h2>

        <p>I remember walking barefoot on the warm sand, the salty breeze brushing against my face. The sky was a brilliant blue, and the sound of crashing waves was mesmerizing.</p>

        <p>As I got closer to the water, I couldn’t believe how vast the ocean looked. It was like looking at the edge of the world. I dipped my feet into the cool water and felt a sense of peace wash over me.</p>

        <p>
            The sun started to set,<br>
            painting the sky in orange and pink hues.<br>
            It was one of the most beautiful sights I’ve ever seen.
